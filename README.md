- Experienced with Terraform for infrastructure as code and AWS SageMaker for AI deployment.
- Certified in Stanford Machine Learning, Google Cloud Generative AI, and Duke University LLMOps.

## Code Examples

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Example
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Deploy to AWS
      run: |
        # Add deployment commands here
```
This example demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, including build, test, and deployment stages.

### Jenkins Pipeline Example
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Building...'
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Testing...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Deploying...'
                // Add deployment commands here
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This example demonstrates a Jenkins pipeline with build, test, and deploy stages, showcasing automation using Jenkins.

### Terraform Infrastructure Deployment Example
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c71c99"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}
```
This example demonstrates a simple Terraform configuration for deploying an AWS EC2 instance, showcasing infrastructure as code.
